## Demo Script Template

### Opening (2 minutes)
```
"Good [morning/afternoon], we're the Smart Traffic Management System team.

Today we're presenting an AI-powered traffic signal optimization system 
that reduces wait times by 22% and increases throughput by 18%.

Let me show you how it works..."
```

### Technical Demo (8 minutes)
```
"First, let's see traditional traffic control..."
[Run baseline demo]

"Now, let's see our ML-optimized system..."
[Run ML demo]

"Here's how it handles rush hour traffic..."
[Run rush hour demo]

"Finally, emergency vehicle priority..."
[Run emergency demo]
```

### Results (3 minutes)
```
"Our A/B testing shows:
- 22% reduction in wait times
- 18% increase in throughput
