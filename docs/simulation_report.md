3. **Scenario Analysis**: Evaluate performance across different traffic conditions (normal, rush hour, emergency)
4. **Comprehensive Metrics**: Assess multiple performance indicators including wait times, throughput, fuel consumption, and emissions
5. **Reproducible Results**: Create a framework for consistent, repeatable testing

### 1.3 Testing Methodology
