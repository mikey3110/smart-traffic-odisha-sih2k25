```yaml
slow_convergence:
  symptoms:
    - "Training loss decreases slowly"
    - "Validation loss plateaus early"
    - "Many epochs required"
  causes:
    - "Learning rate too low"
    - "Network too small"
    - "Poor data quality"
  solutions:
    - "Increase learning rate"
    - "Add more hidden units"
    - "Improve data preprocessing"
    - "Check data quality"
```

#### Overfitting
```yaml
overfitting:
  symptoms:
    - "Training loss << validation loss"
    - "Performance degrades on test set"
    - "High variance in cross-validation"
  causes:
    - "Network too large"
    - "Insufficient regularization"
    - "Too much training data"
  solutions:
    - "Reduce network size"
    - "Increase dropout"
    - "Add L2 regularization"
    - "Use early stopping"
```

#### Underfitting
```yaml
underfitting:
  symptoms:
    - "Training loss >> validation loss"
    - "Poor performance on both sets"
    - "Low variance in cross-validation"
  causes:
    - "Network too small"
    - "Learning rate too low"
    - "Insufficient training data"
  solutions:
    - "Increase network size"
    - "Increase learning rate"
    - "Add more training data"
    - "Reduce regularization"
```

### 2. Performance Issues

#### High Memory Usage
```yaml
high_memory_usage:
  causes:
    - "Large batch size"
    - "Large network"
    - "Large replay buffer"
  solutions:
    - "Reduce batch size"
    - "Use gradient accumulation"
    - "Reduce network size"
    - "Use mixed precision training"
```

#### Slow Inference
```yaml
slow_inference:
  causes:
    - "Large network"
    - "Inefficient implementation"
    - "CPU inference"
  solutions:
    - "Use model quantization"
    - "Optimize implementation"
    - "Use GPU inference"
    - "Use model pruning"
```
