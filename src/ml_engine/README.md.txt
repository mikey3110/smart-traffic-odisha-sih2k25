## üéØ Your Mission
Build smart algorithms to optimize traffic signal timings

## üìã Your Daily Tasks (Sept 9-12)
### Day 1 (Sept 9): Basic Logic
- [ ] Install ML libraries: `pip install stable-baselines3 gymnasium`
- [ ] Create simple rule-based signal optimization
- [ ] If traffic > 10 cars: extend green by 10 seconds
- [ ] Create `signal_optimizer.py` file

### Day 2 (Sept 10): Integration
- [ ] Connect to backend API to get traffic counts
- [ ] Send signal timing recommendations
- [ ] Test with real traffic data

### Day 3 (Sept 11): AI Upgrade
- [ ] Implement reinforcement learning (if time allows)
- [ ] Improve optimization logic
- [ ] Test different scenarios

### Day 4 (Sept 12): Validation
- [ ] Work with SUMO specialist to prove improvements
- [ ] Final algorithm testing
