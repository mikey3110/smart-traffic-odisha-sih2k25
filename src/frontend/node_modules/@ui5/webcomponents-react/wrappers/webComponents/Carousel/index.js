/**
 * The Carousel allows the user to browse through a set of items.
 * The component is mostly used for showing a gallery of images, but can hold any other HTML element.
 *
 * There are several ways to perform navigation:
 *
 * - on desktop - the user can navigate using the navigation arrows or with keyboard shortcuts.
 * - on touch devices - the user can navigate using the navigation arrows (always visible) or can use swipe gestures.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * #### When to use:
 *
 * - The items you want to display are very different from each other.
 * - You want to display the items one after the other.
 *
 * #### When not to use:
 *
 * - The items you want to display need to be visible at the same time.
 * - The items you want to display are uniform and very similar.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 *
 * #### Basic Navigation
 * When the `Carousel` is focused the user can navigate between the items
 * with the following keyboard shortcuts:
 *
 * - [Up] or [Down] - Navigates to previous and next item
 * - [Left] or [Right] - Navigates to previous and next item
 *
 * ### Fast Navigation
 * This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].
 * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js"`
 *
 *
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
