/**
 * The `Switch` component is used for changing between binary states.
 *
 * The component can display texts, that will be switched, based on the component state, via the `textOn` and `textOff` properties,
 * but texts longer than 3 letters will be cutted off.
 *
 * However, users are able to customize the width of `Switch` with pure CSS (`<Switch style="width: 200px">`), and set widths, depending on the texts they would use.
 *
 * Note: the component would not automatically stretch to fit the whole text width.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 * The state can be changed by pressing the Space and Enter keys.
 *
 *
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
