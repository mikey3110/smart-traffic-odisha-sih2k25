/**
 * `SplitButton` enables users to trigger actions. It is constructed of two separate actions -
 * default action and arrow action that can be activated by clicking or tapping, or by
 * pressing certain keyboard keys - `Space` or `Enter` for default action,
 * and `Arrow Down` or `Arrow Up` for arrow action.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * `SplitButton` consists two separate buttons:
 *
 * - for the first one (default action) you can define some `text` or an `icon`, or both.
 * - the second one (arrow action) contains only `slim-arrow-down` icon.
 *
 * You can choose a `design` from a set of predefined types (the same as for ui5-button) that offer
 * different styling to correspond to the triggered action. Both text and arrow actions have the same design.
 *
 * You can set the `SplitButton` as enabled or disabled. Both parts of an enabled
 * `SplitButton` can be pressed by clicking or tapping it, or by certain keys, which changes
 * the style to provide visual feedback to the user that it is pressed or hovered over with
 * the mouse cursor. A disabled `SplitButton` appears inactive and any of the two buttons
 * cannot be pressed.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 *
 * - `Space` or `Enter` - triggers the default action
 * - `Shift` or `Escape` - if `Space` is pressed, releases the default action button without triggering the click event.
 * - `Arrow Down`, `Arrow Up`, `Alt`+`Arrow Down`, `Alt`+`Arrow Up`, or `F4` - triggers the arrow action
 * There are separate events that are fired on activating of `SplitButton` parts:
 *
 * - `click` for the first button (default action)
 * - `arrow-click` for the second button (arrow action)
 *
