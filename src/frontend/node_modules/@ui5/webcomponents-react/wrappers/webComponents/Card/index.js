 * The `Card` is a component that represents information in the form of a
 * tile with separate header and content areas.
 * The content area of a `Card` can be arbitrary HTML content.
 * The header can be used through slot `header`. For which there is a `CardHeader` component to achieve the card look and feel.
 *
 * Note: We recommend the usage of `CardHeader` for the header slot, so advantage can be taken for keyboard handling, styling and accessibility.
