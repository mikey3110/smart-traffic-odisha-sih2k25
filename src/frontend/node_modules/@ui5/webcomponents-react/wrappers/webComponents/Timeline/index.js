/**
 * The `Timeline` component shows entries (such as objects, events, or posts) in chronological order.
 * A common use case is to provide information about changes to an object, or events related to an object.
 * These entries can be generated by the system (for example, value XY changed from A to B), or added manually.
 * There are two distinct variants of the timeline: basic and social. The basic timeline is read-only,
 * while the social timeline offers a high level of interaction and collaboration, and is integrated within SAP Jam.
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
