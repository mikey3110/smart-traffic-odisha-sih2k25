/**
 * `Menu` component represents a hierarchical menu structure.
 *
 * ### Structure
 *
 * The `Menu` can hold two types of entities:
 *
 * - `MenuItem` components
 * - `MenuSeparator` - used to separate menu items with a line
 *
 * An arbitrary hierarchy structure can be represented by recursively nesting menu items.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 *
 * The `Menu` provides advanced keyboard handling.
 * The user can use the following keyboard shortcuts in order to navigate trough the tree:
 *
 * - `Arrow Up` / `Arrow Down` - Navigates up and down the menu items that are currently visible.
 * - `Arrow Right`, `Space` or `Enter` - Opens a sub-menu if there are menu items nested
 * in the currently clicked menu item.
 * - `Arrow Left` or `Escape` - Closes the currently opened sub-menu.
 *
 * when there is `endContent` :
 * - `Arrow Left` or `ArrowRight` - Navigate between the menu item actions and the menu item itself
 * - `Arrow Up` / `Arrow Down` - Navigates up and down the currently visible menu items
 *
 * **Note:** If the text direction is set to Right-to-left (RTL), `Arrow Right` and `Arrow Left` functionality is swapped.
 *
 * Application developers are responsible for ensuring that interactive elements placed in the `endContent` slot
 * have the correct accessibility behaviour, including their enabled or disabled states.
 * The menu does not manage these aspects when the menu item state changes.
 *
 *
