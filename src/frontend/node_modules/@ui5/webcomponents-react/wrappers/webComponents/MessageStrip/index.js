/**
 * The ui5-message-strip component allows for the embedding of application-related messages.
 * It supports four semantic designs, each with its own color and icon: "Information", "Positive", "Critical", and "Negative".
 * Additionally, users can choose from two color sets ("ColorSet1" and "ColorSet2"), each containing 10 predefined color schemes.
 * Each message shows a "Close" button, so that it can be removed from the UI, if needed.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * For the `MessageStrip` component, you can define whether it displays
 * an icon in the beginning and a close button. Moreover, its size and background
 * can be controlled with CSS.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 *
 * #### Fast Navigation
 * This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].
 * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js"`
 *
 *
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
