/**
 * The Bar is a container which is primarily used to hold titles, buttons and input elements
 * and its design and functionality is the basis for page headers and footers.
 * The component consists of three areas to hold its content - startContent slot, default slot and endContent slot.
 * It has the capability to center content, such as a title, while having other components on the left and right side.
 *
 * ### Usage
 * With the use of the design property, you can set the style of the Bar to appear designed like a Header, Subheader, Footer and FloatingFooter.
 *
 * **Note:** Do not place a Bar inside another Bar or inside any bar-like component. Doing so may cause unpredictable behavior.
 *
 * ### Responsive Behavior
 * The default slot will be centered in the available space between the startContent and the endContent areas,
 * therefore it might not always be centered in the entire bar.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 *
 * #### Fast Navigation
 * This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].
 * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js"`
 *
 *
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
