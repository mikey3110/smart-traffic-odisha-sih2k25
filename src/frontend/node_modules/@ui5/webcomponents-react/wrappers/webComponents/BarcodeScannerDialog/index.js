/**
 * The `BarcodeScannerDialog` component provides barcode scanning functionality for all devices that support the `MediaDevices.getUserMedia()` native API.
 * Opening the dialog launches the device camera and scans for known barcode formats.
 *
 * A `scanSuccess` event fires whenever a barcode is identified
 * and a `scanError` event fires when the scan failed (for example, due to missing permisions).
 *
 * Internally, the component  uses the zxing-js/library third party OSS.
 *
 * For a list of supported barcode formats, see the [zxing-js/library](https://github.com/zxing-js/library) documentation.
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
