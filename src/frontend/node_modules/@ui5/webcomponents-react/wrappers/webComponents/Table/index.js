/**
 * The `Table` component provides a set of sophisticated features for displaying and dealing with vast amounts of data in a responsive manner.
 * To render the `Table`, you need to define the columns and rows. You can use the provided `TableHeaderRow` and `TableRow` components for this purpose.
 *
 * ### Features
 *
 * The `Table` can be enhanced in its functionalities by applying different features.
 * Features can be slotted into the `features` slot, to enable them in the component.
 * Features need to be imported separately, as they are not enabled by default.
 *
 * The following features are currently available:
 *
 * * [TableSelection](../TableSelection) - adds selection capabilities to the table
 * * [TableGrowing](../TableGrowing) - provides growing capabilities to load more data
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 *
 * This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].
 * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js"`
 *
 * Furthermore, you can interact with `Table` via the following keys:
 *

 * * <kbd>Down</kbd> - Navigates down
 * * <kbd>Up</kbd> - Navigates up
 * * <kbd>Right</kbd> - Selects the first cell of the row
 * * <kbd>Space</kbd> - Toggles the selection of the row
 * * <kbd>Ctrl/Cmd + A</kbd> - In multi selection mode, toggles the selection of all rows
 * * <kbd>Home</kbd> - Navigates to the first row, if the focus is on the first row, navigates to the header row
 * * <kbd>End</kbd> - Navigates to the last row, if the focus is on the last row, navigates to the growing button
 * * <kbd>Page Up</kbd> - Navigates one page up, if the focus is on the first row, navigates to the header row
 * * <kbd>Page Down</kbd> - Navigates one page down, if the focus is on the last row, navigates to the growing button
 * * <kbd>F2</kbd> - Focuses the first tabbable element in the row
 * * <kbd>F7</kbd> - If focus position is remembered, moves focus to the corresponding focus position row, otherwise to the first tabbable element within the row
 * * <kbd>[Shift]Tab</kbd> - Move focus to the element in the tab chain outside the table
 *

 * * <kbd>Down</kbd> - Navigates down
 * * <kbd>Up</kbd> - Navigates up
 * * <kbd>Right</kbd> - Navigates right
 * * <kbd>Left</kbd> - Navigates left, if the focus is on the first cell of the row, the focus is moved to the row.
 * * <kbd>Home</kbd> - Navigates to the first cell of the current row, if the focus is on the first cell, navigates to the corresponding row
 * * <kbd>End</kbd> - Navigates to the last cell of the current row, if the focus is on the last cell, navigates to the corresponding row
 * * <kbd>Page Up</kbd> - Navigates one page up while keeping the focus in same column
 * * <kbd>Page Down</kbd> - Navigates one page down while keeping the focus in same column
 * * <kbd>F2</kbd> - Toggles the focus between the first tabbable cell content and the cell
 * * <kbd>Enter</kbd> - Focuses the first tabbable cell content
 * * <kbd>F7</kbd> - If the focus is on an interactive element inside a row, moves focus to the corresponding row and remembers the focus position of the element within the row
 * * <kbd>[Shift]Tab</kbd> - Move focus to the element in the tab chain outside the table
 *
 *
 * If the focus is on an interactive cell content, the following keyboard shortcuts are available:
 * * <kbd>Down</kbd> - Move the focus to the interactive element in the same column of the previous row, unless the focused element prevents the default
