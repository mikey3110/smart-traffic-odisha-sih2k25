/**
 * The `TableSelectionMulti` component is used inside the `Table` to add multi-selection capabilities to the `Table`.
 * Since selection is key-based, each `TableRow` must define a unique `row-key` property.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The `TableSelectionMulti` component is a feature designed exclusively for use within the `Table` component.
 * It must be placed inside the `features` slot of `Table`.
 * This component is not intended for standalone use.
 *
 * ```html
 * <Table>
 * 	<TableSelectionMulti slot="features" selected="Row1 Row3"></TableSelectionMulti>
 * </Table>
 * ```
 *
 *
