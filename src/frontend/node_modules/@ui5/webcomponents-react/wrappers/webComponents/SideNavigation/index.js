/**
 * The `SideNavigation` is used as a standard menu in applications.
 * It consists of three containers: header (top-aligned), main navigation section (top-aligned) and the secondary section (bottom-aligned).
 *
 *  - The header is meant for displaying user related information - profile data, avatar, etc.
 *  - The main navigation section is related to the userâ€™s current work context
 *  - The secondary section is mostly used to link additional information that may be of interest (legal information, developer communities, external help, contact information and so on).
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * Use the available `SideNavigationGroup`, `SideNavigationItem`
 * and `SideNavigationSubItem` components to build your menu.
 * The items can consist of text only or an icon with text. The use or non-use of icons must be consistent for all items on one level.
 * You must not combine entries with and without icons on the same level. We strongly recommend that you do not use icons on the second level.
 *
 * The `SideNavigation` component is designed to be used within a `NavigationLayout` component to ensure an optimal user experience.
 *
 * Using it standalone may not match the intended design and functionality.
 * For example, the side navigation may not exhibit the correct behavior on phones and tablets.
 * Padding of the `ShellBar` will not match the padding of the side navigation.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 *
 * ### Fast Navigation
 * This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].
 * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js"`
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/SideNavigationGroup.js";` (for `SideNavigationGroup`)
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/SideNavigationItem.js";` (for `SideNavigationItem`)
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/SideNavigationSubItem.js";` (for `SideNavigationSubItem`)
 *
 * __Note__: This is a UI5 Web Component! [Repository](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents) | [Documentation](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/)
