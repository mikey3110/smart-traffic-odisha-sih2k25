/**
 * The `Link` is a hyperlink component that is used to navigate to other
 * apps and web pages, or to trigger actions.
 * It is a clickable text element, visualized in such a way that it stands out
 * from the standard text.
 * On hover, it changes its style to an underlined text to provide additional feedback to the user.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * You can set the `Link` to be enabled or disabled.
 *
 * To create a visual hierarchy in large lists of links, you can set the less important links as
 * `Subtle` or the more important ones as `Emphasized`,
 * by using the `design` property.
 *
 * If the `href` property is set, the link behaves as the HTML
 * anchor tag (`<a></a>`) and opens the specified URL in the given target frame (`target` property).
 * To specify where the linked content is opened, you can use the `target` property.
 *
 * ### Responsive behavior
 *
 * If there is not enough space, the text of the `Link` becomes truncated.
 * If the `wrappingType` property is set to `"Normal"`, the text is displayed
 * on several lines instead of being truncated.
 *
 *
