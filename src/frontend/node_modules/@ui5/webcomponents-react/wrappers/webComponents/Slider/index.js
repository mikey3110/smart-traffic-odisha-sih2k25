/**
 * The Slider component represents a numerical range and a handle (grip).
 * The purpose of the component is to enable visual selection of a value in
 * a continuous numerical range by moving an adjustable handle.
 *
 * ### Structure
 * The most important properties of the Slider are:
 *
 * - min - The minimum value of the slider range.
 * - max - The maximum value of the slider range.
 * - value - The current value of the slider range.
 * - step - Determines the increments in which the slider will move.
 * - showTooltip - Determines if a tooltip should be displayed above the handle.
 * - showTickmarks - Displays a visual divider between the step values.
 * - labelInterval - Labels some or all of the tickmarks with their values.
 *
 * ### Usage
 * The most common use case is to select values on a continuous numerical scale (e.g. temperature, volume, etc. ).
 *
 * ### Responsive Behavior
 * The `Slider` component adjusts to the size of its parent container by recalculating and
 * resizing the width of the control. You can move the slider handle in several different ways:
 *
 * - Drag and drop the handle to the desired value.
 * - Click/tap on the range bar to move the handle to that location.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 *
 * - `Left or Down Arrow` - Moves the handle one step to the left, effectively decreasing the component's value by `step` amount;
 * - `Right or Up Arrow` - Moves the handle one step to the right, effectively increasing the component's value by `step` amount;
 * - `Left or Down Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd` - Moves the handle to the left with step equal to 1/10th of the entire range, effectively decreasing the component's value by 1/10th of the range;
 * - `Right or Up Arrow + Ctrl/Cmd` - Moves the handle to the right with step equal to 1/10th of the entire range, effectively increasing the component's value by 1/10th of the range;
 * - `Plus` - Same as `Right or Up Arrow`;
 * - `Minus` - Same as `Left or Down Arrow`;
 * - `Home` - Moves the handle to the beginning of the range;
 * - `End` - Moves the handle to the end of the range;
 * - `Page Up` - Same as `Right or Up + Ctrl/Cmd`;
 * - `Page Down` - Same as `Left or Down + Ctrl/Cmd`;
 * - `Escape` - Resets the value property after interaction, to the position prior the component's focusing;
 *
 *
