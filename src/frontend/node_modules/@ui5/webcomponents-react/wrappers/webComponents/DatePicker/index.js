/**
 * The `DatePicker` component provides an input field with assigned calendar which opens on user action.
 * The `DatePicker` allows users to select a localized date using touch,
 * mouse, or keyboard input. It consists of two parts: the date input field and the
 * date picker.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The user can enter a date by:
 *
 * - Using the calendar that opens in a popup
 * - Typing it in directly in the input field
 *
 * When the user makes an entry and presses the enter key, the calendar shows the corresponding date.
 * When the user directly triggers the calendar display, the actual date is displayed.
 *
 * ### Formatting
 *
 * If a date is entered by typing it into
 * the input field, it must fit to the used date format.
 *
 * Supported format options are pattern-based on Unicode LDML Date Format notation.
 * For more information, see [UTS #35: Unicode Locale Data Markup Language](https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).
 *
 * For example, if the `format-pattern` is "yyyy-MM-dd",
 * a valid value string is "2015-07-30" and the same is displayed in the input.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 * The `DatePicker` provides advanced keyboard handling.
 * If the `DatePicker` is focused,
 * you can open or close the drop-down by pressing [F4], [Alt] + [Up] or [Alt] + [Down] keys.
 * Once the drop-down is opened, you can use the [Up], [Down], [Left] or [Right] arrow keys
 * to navigate through the dates and select one by pressing the `Space` or `Enter` keys. Moreover you can
 * use TAB to reach the buttons for changing month and year.
 *
 * If the `DatePicker` input field is focused and its corresponding picker dialog is not opened,
 * then users can increment or decrement the date referenced by `dateValue` property
 * by using the following shortcuts:
 *
 * - [Page Down] - Decrements the corresponding day of the month by one
 * - [Shift] + [Page Down] - Decrements the corresponding month by one
 * - [Shift] + [Ctrl] + [Page Down] - Decrements the corresponding year by one
 * - [Page Up] - Increments the corresponding day of the month by one
 * - [Shift] + [Page Up] - Increments the corresponding month by one
 * - [Shift] + [Ctrl] + [Page Up] - Increments the corresponding year by one
 *
 * ### Calendar types
 * The component supports several calendar types - Gregorian, Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese and Persian.
 * By default the Gregorian Calendar is used. In order to use the Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese or Persian calendar,
 * you need to set the `primaryCalendarType` property and import one or more of the following modules:
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Buddhist.js";`
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Islamic.js";`
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Japanese.js";`
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Persian.js";`
 *
 * Or, you can use the global configuration and set the `calendarType` key:
 *
 * ```html
 * <script data-id="sap-ui-config" type="application/json">
 * 	{
 * 		"calendarType": "Japanese"
 * 	}
 * <script>
 * ```
 *
 *
