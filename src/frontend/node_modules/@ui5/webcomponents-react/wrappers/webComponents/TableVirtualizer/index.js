/**
 * The `TableVirtualizer` component is used inside the `Table` to virtualize the table rows, if the `overflowMode` property of the table is set to 'Scroll'.
 * It is responsible for rendering only the rows that are visible in the viewport and updating them on scroll.
 * This allows large numbers of rows to exist, but maintain high performance by only paying the cost for those that are currently visible.
 *
 * **Note:** The maximum number of virtualized rows is limited by browser constraints, specifically the maximum supported height for a DOM element.
 *
 *
