/**
 * The `Calendar` component allows users to select one or more dates.
 *
 * Currently selected dates are represented with instances of `CalendarDate` as
 * children of the `Calendar`. The value property of each `CalendarDate` must be a
 * date string, correctly formatted according to the `Calendar`'s `formatPattern` property.
 * Whenever the user changes the date selection, `Calendar` will automatically create/remove instances
 * of `CalendarDate` in itself, unless you prevent this behavior by calling `preventDefault()` for the
 * `selection-change` event. This is useful if you want to control the selected dates externally.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * The user can navigate to a particular date by:
 *
 * - Pressing over a month inside the months view
 * - Pressing over an year inside the years view
 *
 * The user can confirm a date selection by pressing over a date inside the days view.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 * The `Calendar` provides advanced keyboard handling.
 * When a picker is showed and focused the user can use the following keyboard
 * shortcuts in order to perform a navigation:
 *
 * - Day picker:
 *
 * - [F4] - Shows month picker
 * - [Shift] + [F4] - Shows year picker
 * - [Page Up] - Navigate to the previous month
 * - [Page Down] - Navigate to the next month
 * - [Shift] + [Page Up] - Navigate to the previous year
 * - [Shift] + [Page Down] - Navigate to the next year
 * - [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Page Up] - Navigate ten years backwards
 * - [Ctrl] + [Shift] + [Page Down] - Navigate ten years forwards
 * - [Home] - Navigate to the first day of the week
 * - [End] - Navigate to the last day of the week
 * - [Ctrl] + [Home] - Navigate to the first day of the month
 * - [Ctrl] + [End] - Navigate to the last day of the month
 *
 * - Month picker:
 *
 * - [Page Up] - Navigate to the previous year
 * - [Page Down] - Navigate to the next year
 * - [Home] - Navigate to the first month of the current row
 * - [End] - Navigate to the last month of the current row
 * - [Ctrl] + [Home] - Navigate to the first month of the current year
 * - [Ctrl] + [End] - Navigate to the last month of the year
 *
 * - Year picker:
 *
 * - [Page Up] - Navigate to the previous year range
 * - [Page Down] - Navigate the next year range
 * - [Home] - Navigate to the first year of the current row
 * - [End] - Navigate to the last year of the current row
 * - [Ctrl] + [Home] - Navigate to the first year of the current year range
 * - [Ctrl] + [End] - Navigate to the last year of the current year range
 *
 * #### Fast Navigation
 * This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].
 * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js"`
 *
 * ### Calendar types
 * The component supports several calendar types - Gregorian, Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese and Persian.
 * By default the Gregorian Calendar is used. In order to use the Buddhist, Islamic, Japanese or Persian calendar,
 * you need to set the `primaryCalendarType` property and import one or more of the following modules:
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Buddhist.js";`
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Islamic.js";`
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Japanese.js";`
 *
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-localization/dist/features/calendar/Persian.js";`
 *
 * Or, you can use the global configuration and set the `calendarType` key:
 *
 * ```html
 * <script data-id="sap-ui-config" type="application/json">
 * 	{
 * 		"calendarType": "Japanese"
 * 	}
 * </script>
 * ```
 *
 *
