/**
 * The `FlexibleColumnLayout` implements the list-detail-detail paradigm by displaying up to three pages in separate columns.
 * There are several possible layouts that can be changed either with the component API, or by dragging the column separators.
 *
 * ### Usage
 *
 * Use this component for applications that need to display several logical levels of related information side by side (e.g. list of items, item, sub-item, etc.).
 * The Component is flexible in a sense that the application can focus the user's attention on one particular column.
 *
 * ### Responsive Behavior
 *
 * The `FlexibleColumnLayout` automatically displays the maximum possible number of columns based on `layout` property and the window size.
 * The component would display 1 column for window size smaller than 599px, up to two columns between 599px and 1023px,
 * and 3 columns for sizes bigger than 1023px.
 *
 * **Note:** When the component displays more than one column, the minimal width of each column is 248px. Consequently, when the user drags a column separator to resize the columns, the minimal allowed width of any resized column is 248px.
 *
 * ### Keyboard Handling
 *
 * #### Basic Navigation
 *
 * When a column separator is focused,  the following keyboard
 * shortcuts allow the user to resize the columns and change the layout:
 *
 * - [Shift] + [Left] or [Shift] + [Right] - Moves the separator to the left or right, which resizes the columns accordingly.
 * - [Left] or [Right] - Moves the separator to the left or right with a bigger step, which resizes the columns accordingly.
 * - [Home] - Moves the separator to the start position.
 * - [End] - Moves the separator to the end position.
 * - This component provides a build in fast navigation group which can be used via [F6] / [Shift] + [F6] / [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] / [Down] or [Ctrl] + [Alt/Option] + [Up].
 * In order to use this functionality, you need to import the following module:
 * `import "@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/features/F6Navigation.js"`
