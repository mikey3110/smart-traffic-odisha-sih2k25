## 🎯 Your Mission
Detect and count vehicles in traffic videos using AI

## 📋 Your Daily Tasks (Sept 9-12)
### Day 1 (Sept 9): Basic Detection
- [ ] Install OpenCV and YOLO: `pip install opencv-python ultralytics`
- [ ] Download traffic videos to `../../data/videos/`
- [ ] Get basic vehicle detection working
- [ ] Create `vehicle_detector.py` file

### Day 2 (Sept 10): Integration  
- [ ] Connect detection to backend API
- [ ] Send vehicle counts every 5 seconds
- [ ] Test real-time processing

### Day 3 (Sept 11): Optimization
